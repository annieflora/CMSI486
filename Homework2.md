**Assignment 2**

_____________

**Problem #1**
**Ch 9, #3:** 
*Try to map the relational schema in Figure 6.14 [page 189] into an ER schema. This is part of a process known as reverse engineering, in which a conceptual schema is created for an existing implemented database. State any assumptions you make.*

_____________
**Problem #2**
**Ch 9, #7:** 
*Is it possible to successfully map a binary M:N relationship type without requiring a new relation? Why or why not?*

_____________
**Problem #3**
**Ch 10, #3:**
*Why is it important to design the schemas and applications in parallel?*

_____________
**Problem #4**
**Ch 10, #4:**
*Why is it important to use an implementation-independent data model during conceptual schema design? What models are used in current design tools? Wny?*

_____________
**Problem #5**
**Ch 10, #6:** 
*Consider an actual application of a database system of interest. [NOTE: this means pick one you are familiar with to use for this exercise.] Define the requirements of the different levels of users in terms of data needed, types of queries, and transactions to be processed.*

_____________
**Problem #6**
**Ch 15, #5:**
*What is a functional dependency? What are the possible sources of the information that defines the functional dependencies that hold among the attributes of a relation schema?*

_____________
**Problem #7**
**Ch 15, #9:**
*What undesirable dependencies are avoided when a relation is in 2NF?*

_____________
**Problem #8**
**Ch 15, #10:** 
*What undesirable dependencies are avoided when a relation is in 3NF?*

_____________
**Problem #9**
**Ch 15, #13:**
*What is a multivalued dependencey? When does it arise?*

_____________
**Problem #10**
**Ch 21, #1:**
*What is meant by the concurrent execution of database transactions in a multiuser system? Dicscuss why concurrency control is needed, and give informal examples.*

_____________
**Problem #11**
**Ch 21, #6:** 
*Discuss the atomicity, durability, isolation, and consistency preservations properties of a database transaction.*

_____________
**Problem #12**
**Ch 4, #1:**
*The four fundamental data constructs of Neo4j are [select one and describe each of the items in your selection]:
Table, record, field, and constraint
Node, relationship, property, and schema
Node, relationship, property, and label
Document, relationship, property, and collection*

_____________
**Problem #13**
**Ch 4, #3:** 
*If you have a few entities in your dataset that have lots of relationships to other entities, then you can't use a graph database because of the dense node problem.
True – you will have to use a relational system
True – but there is no alternative, so you will have to live with it
False – you can still use a graph database but it will be painfully slow for all queries
False – you can very effectively use a graph database, but you should take precautions, for example, applying a fan-out pattern to your data*
